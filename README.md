# gift-registry-app
For project 2 of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive, I plan to build a birthday list app which is essentially a gift registry whereby users can share their birthday lists with friends and family.


### Structure of web app
The app will comprise the following pages / features:
* User sign up page
* Ability to join an existing group(s) 
* Abiility to create a new group and invite others to join
* Ability to create a new birthday list, and share with others via a unique code 
* Ability for birthday person to edit an existing list
* Ability for friends to change gift status from Wanted to Purchased
* Ability to delete list


### Extensions 
If time I may add some of the following:
* Ability to comment on gift lists
* Integration with API, e.g. Amazon
* Auto gift suggestion
* Options to share list with a unique URL


### Challenges
* How to ensure codes are unique and not duplicated?


### User stories 
As the birthday person, I want to:
* Easily add / remove gifts from the list
* Easily share my list with my friends/family, even those who may not wish to sign up

As a friend of the birthday person, I want to:
* View the list without having to sign up
* Change the status of a gift if I am purchasing it, so others don't purchase it as well


### Technology used
* Web server: Python flask
* Database: postgresql 
* Front end: HTML, CSS, Javascript (TBC)
